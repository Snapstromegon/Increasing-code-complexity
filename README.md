Every day, I commit a new and more complicated version of some simple code. 

See https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/y6iuto/lets_do_it/

Day 1:
Created simple code that prints "Hello world!" 10 times.

Day 2:
Replaced the for loop with ```for i in ("HelloWorld"):```

Day 3:
Migrate to Rust to fix #6
